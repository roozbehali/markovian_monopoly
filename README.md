# Modelling Monopoly with Markov Chains

This is my HL Math AA internal assessment, a project where you are allowed to explore any out-of-syllabus topic. I chose to use Markov Chains to find the most optimal properties on the Monopoly board to buy. The math can be found in my paper, linked in the "About". Try this in your next Monopoly game. Nobody will want to play with you again.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Python 3, numPy, and pandas installed.

### Installing

Install Python 3. Then,

```
pip install numpy
```

```
pip install pandas
```

## Usage instructions

Run 'simulator.py' if you would like to compile your own results table. This file simply runs 'script.py' 1000 times, where 'script.py' walks through the transition matrix created by 'revised.py'. The updated rankings will be in 'ordered.csv'. You can view these in a more readable format here: https://csv-viewer-online.github.io/

## Built With
